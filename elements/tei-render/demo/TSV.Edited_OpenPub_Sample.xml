            <p>This document is a student-edited XML version of <hi rend="italic">The Sea Voyage</hi> based on Pennsylvania State University's
                annotated copy of the 1647 Beaumont &#38; Fletcher first folio. The student body of Claire M. L. Bourne's fall 2019 ENGL 445 "Shakespeare's
                Contemporaries" course determined many of the editorial principles themselves. Where necessary, these have been complemented by principles
                and practices established by the general editor of the play in consultation with the consulting editor. The intention of this edition is to
                present a working XML version of the play that honors student contributions and editorial decisions.</p>

Thunder and lightning. <note resp="#student" type="context"><hi rend="italic">Thunder and lightning:</hi> In early modern plays, the stage direction "thunder and lightning" was very common and produced in a variety of different ways. In this play, it's assumed that the stage direction "thunder and lightning" is directly linked to a storm, but this was rarely the case in many early modern plays. <bibl>Dessen, Alan C., and Leslie Thomson. <title>A Dictionary of Stage Directions in English Drama, 1580-1642.</title> Cambridge University Press, 1999.</bibl> Making the sounds of thunder and lightning, then, could have been done through drums, flashes of fire, and fireworks. Thunder and lightning can be considered a sound cue and therefore grouped with others such as "trumpet" and "music." These types of stage directions were often created in the tiring house, as they were either directed toward or written by the bookkeeper who would then produce the stage directions on cue. <bibl>Thomson, Leslie. “The Meaning of ‘Thunder and Lightning’: Stage Directions and Audience Expectations.” <title>Early Theatre</title>, vol. 2, 1999, pp. 11–24. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/43499089.</bibl> In most cases though, the effects of thunder and lightning were linked to the supernatural, and accompanied figures such devils and witches, which would descend from a trapdoor that signified the underworld. An audience could almost always expect to view something supernatural with this particular stage direction. <bibl>Thomson, Leslie. “The Meaning of ‘Thunder and Lightning’: Stage Directions and Audience Expectations.” <title>Early Theatre</title>, vol. 2, 1999, pp. 11–24.

Therefore, in order to portray some sort of sea voyage, the use of ropes, tackle boxes, and other sailing equipment could have aided the impression of being at sea, with characters pulling on cords found in the tiring house. The stage of the play was seen as the deck, the tiring house as the cabin of the ship, and the balcony as the mast or the lookout area. During this play, it's also clear that the characters on the boat are fighting against strong waves. However, it's impossible to create actual movement that comes with voyaging, so this illusion could have been made by the characters acting wild and hysterical. <bibl>McInnis, David. <title>Mind-Travelling and Voyage Drama in Early Modern England.</title> Palgrave Macmillan, 2013.</bibl></note>
