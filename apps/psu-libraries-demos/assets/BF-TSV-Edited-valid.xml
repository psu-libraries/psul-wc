                                    lightning</term>: In early modern plays, the stage direction
                                "thunder and lightning" was very common, and the effects of thunder
                                and lightning produced in a variety of different ways. In this play,
                                it's assumed that the stage direction "thunder and lightning" is
                                directly linked to a storm, but this was not always the case in many
                                early modern plays (<ref target="#acd1999">Dessen and Thomson, 231</ref>). Making
                                the sounds of thunder and lightning could have been achieved through
                                drums, flashes of fire, and fireworks. These types of stage
                                directions were often created in the tiring house, as they were
                                either directed toward or written by the bookkeeper who would then
                                produce the stage effect on cue (<ref target="#lt1999">Thomson, 14</ref>). In many
                                cases, the effects of thunder and lightning were linked to the
                                supernatural, and accompanied figures such as devils and witches,
                                who would ascend from a trapdoor that signified the underworld. An
                                audience would expect something supernatural when this particular
                                effect occurs (<ref target="#lt1999">Thomson, 11</ref>).</note></stage>

                                            ><term>How she kicks and jerks</term>: It's important to
                                        remember that a performer in early modern plays could have
                                        expected to perform in a venue that was "a rectangular,
                                        flat, largely empty stage [with] nosets in the modern sense"
                                            (<ref target="#hss2015">Syme, 112</ref>). Thus, we can assume that there
                                        was not actually a physical ship on stage. Therefore, in
                                        order to portray some sort of sea voyage, the use of ropes,
                                        tackle boxes, and other sailing equipment could have aided
                                        the impression of being at sea, with characters pulling on
                                        cords found in the tiring house. The stage of the play was

                                        sin breeders" the shipmaster is referring to are women
                                        (here, specifically, Aminta, as she is the only woman on the
                                        boat). The shipmaster believes that everyone on the ship is
                                        going to die because they won't have any help from the
                                        heavens, and he blames this entirely on Aminta. Many times,
                                        women were denied passage on ships; if they happened to be
                                        on board, they were either a captive, a slave, or being
                                        forced to marry (<ref target="#gpm2019">Moore, 318</ref>). In line XXX, it
                                        becomes clear that Aminta has been captured by Albert, and
                                        that he has forced her to be on his ship for his own
                                        pleasure. Ironically, Aminta is only on the ship because of
                                        him, yet she is still being blamed for the dangerous
                                        storm.</note></l>

                                            hate ye!</term>: In the 1647 text of the play, question
                                        marks are used to punctuate "Oh ... redeem me" and "How ...
                                        ye," but sometimes, in the seventeenth century, compositors
                                        would use question marks where we would use exclamation
                                        points today (<ref target="#mpj2007">Jackson, 549</ref>). Thus, the lines
                                        (as presented here) illustrate Aminta's raging anger and
                                        hatred for Albert if their question marks are meant to be
                                        interpreted as exclamation points. Question marks in this
                                        scene give off a completely different meaning: they would
                                        account for Aminta's confusion as to whether she should
                                        curse and hate Albert. Regardless, one cannot be sure as to
                                        when Aminta exactly falls in love with Albert, but it's
                                        crucial to consider that she is ultimately his prisoner
                                        before their love blossoms.</note></l>

                                            sir.</term>: On board this ship, there is a very
                                        interesting mix of characters from various social classes.
                                        Three of the men—Lamure, Franville, and Morillat—are French
                                        lords. In the early modern period, clothing helped establish
                                        a person's identity and located their position in a variety
                                        of categories ranging from gender, class, nationality, and
                                        religion (<ref target="#ril2003">Lublin, 10</ref>). Thus, when Lamure's
                                        clothes and goods are thrown overboard, his response is that
                                        he feels completely ruined and destroyed (i.e. "undone").
                                        Although this may seem dramatic to the modern reader, these
                                        characters experience a loss of material goods as a loss of
                                        identity. Furthermore, because Lamure is a self-made man
                                        (lines XXX), he loses the noble identity he has created for
                                        himself and is now seen as equal to those of a lower class
                                        that he spent "twenty years" trying to buy his way out
                                        of.</note></l>

                                        possessions are "false dice," which are trick or weighted
                                        dice. Used as a prop, they are a physical manifestation for
                                        the actor to demonstrate the kind of wayward person that
                                        Tibalt is. And if the dice are not shown on stage and are
                                        instead just mentioned by name only, then it grants a quick
                                        snapshot of someone who values a handful of cheat dice as
                                        some of the things he keeps with him when he has so few
                                        possessions: "skin," "clothes," "sword," "self," "two
                                        crowns," "two pair of cards," and "three false dice" (lines
                                        XXX-XXX). His possessions portray him as a kind of traveling
                                        vagabond, a drifter that goes town to town and makes a

                                        monologue acts as a social commentary and revolves around
                                        how much importance noblemen gave to their material
                                        possessions, to the point where they evaluated their virtues
                                        and characters based on material goods. He begins with
                                        comparing their skins to gifts from the goddess of beauty
                                        and love that would never go out of fashion or abandon them
                                        until their bodies decayed after death and were devoured by
                                        worms. The purpose of this monologue is to acquaint the
                                        audience (and readers) with how social hierarchy was
                                        determined by material possessions by having Tibalt satirize
                                        the social practice. He suggests that clothes depicting our
                                        accomplishments as individuals is just as ridiculous as fish
                                        appearing in the clothes that have now sunk to the bottom of
                                        the sea.</note></l>

                                            Nature (here, personified) for putting him and Aminta
                                            into this harsh environment. To bolster his point, he
                                            provides two examples of Nature's unfair treatment of
                                            them: the first one is that nature gives a "drunkard"
                                            more wine, and a "glutton" more food, though the
                                            drunkard has already drunk and has no need for more
                                            wine, and the glutton already has enough food. Thus,
                                            Albert attempts to shame Nature into providing aid to
                                            her more deserving victims, especially Aminta (a
                                            "virgin" who is "pin[ing] for

                                        the music from the Amazonian island that would have
                                        influences from Portugal, and possibly its colonies in the
                                        Middle East and West India. The play is written in the midst
                                        of colonial dominion in Europe, indicated by how it mimics
                                            <title>The Tempest</title>. It is possible some of the
                                        common music instruments possessed by the Portuguese (or
                                        what was imagined to be possessed by them) can be showcased
                                        on stage. One possible sound that can be recreated on stage
                                        is of the <hi rend="italic">adufe</hi>, a square
                                        double-skinned frame drum. The skins are sewn together,
                                        often with seeds between them; it is held with the thumbs of
                                        both hands and the pointer of the right hand, leaving the
                                        other fingers free to hit the instrument. This instrument
                                        was introduced into Portugal (and Spain) when the Moors of
                                        North Africa invaded the Iberian Peninsula, beginning in the
                                        early 700s A.D. As the music is also accompanied by the
                                        adjective "hunter's," Fletcher and Massinger may be
                                        referring to these 'exotic' (i.e. tribal) instruments from
                                        North Africa.</note></l>

                                        phrase "Arabian groves" is vague, it could suggest the
                                        increased cross-pollination of horticulture between Europe
                                        and the Middle East and India. Portugal had colonized
                                        several territories (Bahrain, Sohar, Julfar, Quriyat), now
                                        constituting modern-day Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
                                        Emirates, during the reign of the Iberian Union between
                                        1580-1640 (<ref target="#dom1972">de Oliveira Marques, 322</ref>). The
                                        Amazons are also believed to have originated in Libya and to
                                        have migrated across Syria, Egypt, Scythia
                                            (<ref target="#af2014">Foreman</ref>). The Arabian groves reference
                                        could refer to the coconut and palm trees that were commonly
                                        seen on the coast of Southwest India. After the conquests of
                                        Vasco Da Gama, Portugal colonized territories like Bombay
                                        and Goa by the Arabian Sea before India's major colonization
                                        by the British in the late seventeenth century

                                        for Indian horticultural features to appear in an imagined
                                        Portuguese aesthetic.</note></l>

                                            invisible because of the commonwealth's law against
                                            interacting with men. More likely, though, this refers
                                            to the belief that chameleons survived solely on air

                                        of the siren to reinforce her argument that men are
                                        dangerously manipulative. Based in Greek mythology, "sirens"
                                        were creatures that were part-women, part-bird or mermaid.
                                        They would lure sailors to destruction by enchanting them
                                        with song. Sirens have been traditionally gendered as women,
                                        but Rosella inverts this association, emphasizing Albert's
                                        manipulation. This linguistic inversion points to the larger
                                        theme of reversing traditional gender roles within
                                        play.</note> Have I not taught thee</l>

                                            males ... reserve ourselves</term>: Rosella's command is
                                        that any boys born by the commonwealth women will be given
                                        to the men, while any girls will stay with the women and
                                        become part of the commonwealth. The Amazons were supposedly
                                        neighbors to an all-male society called the Gargareans. They
                                        met annually for a mating ritual. The female children born
                                        after this ritual were retained by the Amazons, and the male
                                        children went to their fathers (<ref target="#sg1928">Strabo</ref>).
                                        Rosella's reference to this practice of mating with an
                                        all-male society had historical precedent. It also provides
                                        some geographical hints. As the Gargareans and Amazons are
                                        believed to have reigned between Eurasia and the Middle
                                        East, the play hints at taking place in the Mediterranean or
                                        Black Sea. (Indeed, the play references a black river
                                        between the barren and fertile islands.)</note> This is the

                                        (present in the 1647 folio text) adds a level of ambiguity
                                        to the exit. Later instances of long dashes in the 1647
                                        folio are used to indicate interruptions in the dialogue.
                                        Therefore, we could assume that Albert is being interrupted
                                        at the closing of the scene, though the text does not give
                                        indication of exactly what or who could be interrupting
                                        Albert. The long dash could allow actors to vary the
                                        portrayal of this end scene. One implication could be that
                                        Albert and Clarinda walk out of the stage with redundant
                                        pleasantries, formalities, and exchanges that the authors
                                        and printers did not deem worthy of consuming the page's
                                        highly sought-for space. Another implication could be that
                                        the next scene immediately follows as they exit. The dash
                                        could also represent space on the page, indicating that more
                                        words were spoken here, up to the actors' or the company's
                                        discretion or improvisation.</note></l>

                                        version of the idiom: "one man's poison is another man's
                                        meat," essentially meaning "people have different tastes" or
                                        "value is relative." The idiom was used by Beaumont and
                                        Fletcher's contemporary Thomas Middleton in his 1604 work
                                            <title>Plato's Cap</title> ("That old moth-eaten
                                        proverb... One man's meat, is another man's poison"), though
                                        also by Beaumont himself in <title>Love's Cure</title>,
                                        which was also published for the first time in the 1647
                                        folio: "What's one man's poison, Signor, is another's meat
                                        or drink." In a literal way, the palates of the shipwrecked
                                        nobles must shift from meat to mud ("poison"). At the same
                                        time, it may suggest that societal rules/morality is also
                                        relative: one man's good behavior (meat) is another one's
                                        bad (poison) and vice versa. But in the context of the
                                        shipwreck, "poison" suggests a kind of moral suspension: the
                                        behavior that was once deemed bad in society is no longer
                                        considered bad on the island.</note></l>

                                        primarily refers to a rooster's crest, or a "cock's comb."
                                        Given that jester hats resemble roosters' crests, and
                                        jesters are fools, the word "coxcomb" evolved to describe
                                        not only the jester's cap but fools themselves. The word
                                        "coxcomb" can also describe a vain, pretentious, and foppish
                                        person, perhaps because roosters are viewed as prideful. In
                                        other words, someone described as a coxcomb pretends to be
                                        stylish and educated. As jesters are the noble's personal
                                        comedians and storytellers, Franville's use takes on
                                        additional meaning. The insult could imply that Aminta's
                                        relative is pseudo-nobility who amuses other nobles with
                                        attempts at legitimacy. Given that the men believe it is
                                        okay for superiors eat their inferiors, Franville's
                                        disqualification of Aminta's family may also justify his
                                        turn to cannibalism.</note>—</l>

                                        in the Americas was largely reviled by Europeans. However,
                                        during the period this play was written there was also a
                                        medicinal cannibalistic culture thriving throughout Europe.
                                        The medicinal discourse between Lamure, Morrilat, Franville,
                                        and the Surgeon earlier in the play are relevant to this
                                        discussion in that they consider eating a "wen" that was
                                        pulled from one of the sailor's shoulders during the voyage.
                                        Prior to this, the group primarily discusses tools of
                                        medicine; the brief mention of "cordials," "potions," and
                                        "pills" takes on a different meaning due to many medications
                                        being made from human parts, with some of the most common
                                        sources being blood and bone

                                                the humorous parts</term>: In pre-modern physiology,
                                            the humors were four different fluids in the body; when
                                            imbalanced, one's body and mood risked falling out of
                                            health and displaying the symptoms respective to the
                                            type of imbalance. The word "humorous" is also used to
                                            mean moody or capricious. Being a doctor (and thus
                                            knowledgeable of the humors), the Surgeon wishes to
                                            remove them from Aminta's body before the men eat her.
                                            Yet the act of removing her humors is telling. In one
                                            way, he expresses concern for his health by emptying the
                                            humors: if he were to eat Aminta's humors, he could
                                            contract an imbalance—whether an excess or a deficit—of
                                            his own humors. At the same time, Aminta is female and
                                            so stereotyped in early modern drama as capricious and
                                            changeable. This could suggest the Surgeon fears he
                                            could contract her emotionality over his "balanced" male
                                            rationality if he were to eat her. This line could also
                                            be read, more simply, as an indication of the Surgeon's
                                            desire to eat the humorous (i.e. "juicy") parts of her

                                            their eagerness for predatory behavior. That said, this
                                            use of "sharp-set" figures the shipwrecked nobles as
                                            savage beasts. Yet another definition of "sharp-set" is
                                            "having a craving for sexual indulgence," which also
                                            promotes the connection between food and sexual craving
                                            that appears throughout the passage. For example, with
                                            the first use of sharp-set, the men argue over who gets
                                            to eat her buttocks, and with the second use, Tibalt
                                            asks if the men are so hungry that Aminta's "flesh" must
                                            "serve" them, here again evoking sexual indulgence. As
                                            Aminta is the only woman on the barren island, it is
                                            worth noting that the cannibalism directed towards
                                            her—i.e., to consume her—is meant to be read as a sexual
                                            metaphor.</note></seg> that her <seg resp="#student"

                                    <term>Ourselves your creatures</term>: In this passage,
                                        Albert pledges the men's subservience to Rosella and appears
                                        to reverse the patriarchal assumptions of early modern
                                        social relations. "Creatures," in this sense, likely refers
                                        to someone "who owes his fortune or position, and remains
                                        subservient to, a patron," and who also is "ready to do
                                        another's bidding" (<bibl>OED</bibl>). According to Albert,
                                        then, the Frenchmen are not only willing to subjugate
                                        themselves to these women, but also are willing to do their
                                        bidding (sexually or otherwise). What makes this passage
                                        especially interesting is how quickly its effects are
                                        reversed; just ten lines later, Rosella cedes power back to
                                        the men. These quick-shifting dynamics are likely related to
                                        the comedic genre of the play, as the playwrights keep
                                        switching back and forth between giving their French
                                        protagonists patriarchal power and taking it away from
                                        them.</note></l>

                                        As Tibalt explains how he selected a partner for Albert, he
                                        refers to astrology, saying that Albert was born under
                                        Saturn, "a malignant planet," which caused him to be prone
                                        to melancholy. In the early modern period, the medical
                                        belief in the humoral system still persisted. This meant
                                        that there were four bodily "humors": phlegm, yellow bile,
                                        blood, and black bile, that could cause various issues if
                                        these fluids were unbalanced. Melancholy was the term for an
                                        excess of black bile. The humoral system often was used in
                                        conjunction with theories about the planets (namely, the
                                        moon, Mars, Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn). In this case,
                                        Tibalt selects Clarinda because he claims that she is a
                                        "soft, ruddy wench born under Venus." This, according to
                                        Tibalt should restore Albert's balance and counteract his
                                        melancholic tendencies. Melancholy was also blamed for
                                        hallucinations, sudden outbursts, and other signs of
                                        madness.</note></l>

                                            <term>idol of lapidary</term>: The phrase "idol of
                                        lapidary" begins a series of descriptions of the treasure by
                                        the Frenchmen that seemingly elevates its value to a
                                        mythical quality through associations with a diverse variety
                                        of individuals—slaves, merchants, royalty, sailors—who would
                                        go to immense lengths to possess it. "Idol of lapidary" also
                                        implies that the treasure is a divine object of worship,
                                        perhaps even beyond one's love of God. While these
                                        descriptions aim to impress Rosella, in a larger sense they
                                        function to afford the men themselves material value
                                        alongside their sexual value to the women. It is therefore
                                        of utmost importance to the Frenchmen to upsell the value of
                                        the treasure. Furthermore, in a narrative with characters
                                        like Lamure, Franville, and Morillat, whose identities are
                                        strongly rooted in their material wealth (as first seen in
                                        Act 1, Scene 1 during the storm), perhaps these
                                        people-related descriptions of value mirror their own views
                                        on persona and reflect a genuine desire for such treasure to
                                        re-establish their identities.</note></l>

                                        Rosella's call of gratitude to the stars for bringing her an
                                        opportunity for revenge subtly contrasts Albert's earlier
                                        pleas to a Christian heaven. While both reference some type
                                        of higher force intertwined with the Christian beliefs of
                                        the time, Rosella references a naturalistic force that, in a
                                        larger sense, emphasizes the women's eschewing of societal
                                        and religious conventions in their isolated environment. The
                                        women are previously characterized alongside the Greek
                                        goddess Artemis as independent, chaste hunters and with
                                        Artemis' associations with the moon. Here, the women appeal
                                        to a Greek, polytheistic religion that places belief in the
                                        power of celestial bodies like the moon and the stars. This
                                        association also perhaps alludes to the idea of women
                                        constantly changing and being influenced by nature. Taken
                                        together with the men's references to conventional Christian
                                        ideas of God and heaven, a rhetorical battle is created not

                                            ><term>jointures</term>: The original definition of
                                        "jointure" is rooted in marriage conventions, referring to
                                        an arrangement between a husband and wife to hold a property
                                        jointly so that the property may be settled on the wife if
                                        she is widowed. It also has been used an equivalent term to
                                        a dowry. Tibalt's use of "jointures," then, might allude to
                                        the societal and patriarchal need to establish order through
                                        marital and legal conventions, particularly as this usage
                                        occurs in the face of a woman's (Rosella's) anger. However,
                                        the suggested convention of "jointure" is one of the few of
                                        its time that gave women potential independence over their
                                        estate, and so it may also be rhetorically appropriate that
                                        Tibalt offers a share of further wealth to Rosella who is
                                        presumed to be widowed (<ref target="#hjh1950">Habakkuk, 15</ref>). It is
                                        also possible that jointure's associations with dowry
                                        suggest that an intense situation of environment isolated
                                        from societal norms could lead to a switch in gender roles,
                                        such as a man freely offering dowry directly to a
                                        woman.</note>

                                        "gallants" to describe the men that Sebastian and Nicusa
                                        reported being on the island is significant because it
                                        indicates Raymond's class expectations. "Gallants" is a term
                                        that describes young men as "smartly" or" finely-dressed"
                                        who are "gorgeous or showy in appearance." In a way, Raymond
                                        is reminding Sebastian and Nicusa that they had described a
                                        group of men on the island who were well-dressed, which
                                        would mean they are of the higher or wealthier class.
                                        Ironically, "gallants" is a term that is very much the
                                        opposite of what one would expect to find on the barren
                                        island where, as the audience knows by this point, there is
                                        no chance of prosperity. Because these men are so
                                        contrasting to what the island looks like and could support,
                                        it stands to reason that it should also be doubly easy to
                                        find them.</note></l>

                                        definitions can both function simultaneously. Sebastian
                                        could be stating that he does not know what foresight and/or
                                        supplies may have allowed the Frenchmen to guide themselves
                                        away from the island, but he could also be suggesting that
                                        some sort of divine protection and guidance may have played
                                        a part in the men not being present. This call for the
                                        involvement of or help from a higher force is the first of
                                        many from Sebastian, as he and Nicusa are accused further of
                                        making false claims, participating in the absence of the
                                        men, and finally acting unlike Christian gentleman.</note>

                                        Fletcher and Massinger give us a play that can easily be
                                        read as a commentary on the greed driving European
                                        colonization. Rosella's criticism of the French stems from
                                        her view of their actions as an attempt to control their
                                        commonwealth by robbing valuable things from them. As Rita
                                        Banerjee notes, "The critique of piracy in <title>The Sea
                                            Voyage</title> centers especially on the inordinate
                                        desire for gold and treasure" (<ref target="#rb2013">294</ref>). At the
                                        start of the scene, Rosella echoes Tibalt's sentiment from
                                        the beginning of the play when he tells the other men to
                                        resist obsession with riches to preserve their lives.
                                        Because she holds the men responsible for stealing her
                                        husband's treasure, Rosella intends to kill them as revenge,
                                        thus validating Tibalt's prior warning and reinforcing the
                                        critique present throughout the play that riches mean
                                        nothing in the face of death; a focus on lust for gold and
                                        treasure in the play help point out the issues with such
                                        lust.</note></l>

                                    <term>they show mongrels</term>: i.e. they appear as
                                        dogs or persons of mixed or uncertain descent. The word
                                        "mongrel" is chiefly used in a derogatory manner, meaning
                                        that this mixed breeding is indicative of a lower form of
                                        life. This usage implies the importance of purity of
                                        nationality or race and points to an underlying conflict
                                        between the French and Portuguese throughout the play. It is
                                        also important to note that Juletta calls the Frenchmen
                                        "gentlemen," but immediately rescinds that judgement when
                                        discussing their behavior. This juxtaposition of superficial
                                        appearance with demonstrated behavior also denotes a key
                                        conflict throughout the play.</note>.</l>

                                            'em</term>: Juletta's speech here highlights a key
                                        contention throughout the play: the control of physical
                                        sustenance and that of reproductive success, both of which
                                        sustain life. Juletta is responsible for looking after her
                                        group of men: she is the one giving food to them, as well as
                                        presumably exercising sexual dominance over them, as
                                        suggested by her phrasing here. The way in which hunger,
                                        thirst, and sexual desire are regulated contrasts norms that
                                        denied women of the time a good deal of agency; the women in
                                        this play, however, are the ones in charge of all physical
                                        and sexual sustenance. Though this power is given to the
                                        Amazons and reflects an agency not typically experienced by
                                        women, their drive to reproduce was is still consistent with
                                        traditional pressures on women. As Claire Jowitt puts it,
                                        "[T]he text draws a distinction between resources needed for
                                        immediate survival—food and water—and those necessary for
                                        medium and long-term colonization—children to be new
                                        generations of settlers" (<ref target="#cj2001">99</ref>). Though the women
                                        have a level of dominance as the food source for their
                                        prisoners and the survival source for their population, the
                                        burden of having such power is always evident. It is a
                                        burden which certainly arose within royal families when the
                                        queen was required to produce an heir. This would have been
                                        known to a seventeenth-century audience living under a
                                        monarchy. Both reproductive capacity and possession of
                                        property provide authority in the play, yet both also
                                        produce a certain level of balance. Possession and freedom
                                        are intertwined in the play—possession of riches and land
                                        enables possession of other people. The treasure initially
                                        belonged to the Amazons, giving them power, which is then
                                        supplemented by taking the men as their prisoners. But,
                                        eventually the power transfers back to the men when a
                                        concord is reached by marriage.</note></l>

                                        to Albert in her hopes of wooing him acts as a dowry. In
                                        offering it, she also offers salvation as she plans to spare
                                        his life, thus enabling a future for life on the island
                                        itself through reproduction. She is actually reversing the
                                        original cause of enmity between the two groups by giving
                                        the stolen treasure back to him while hoping to attain their
                                        union, which, though she does not end up doing, represents
                                        the play's harmonious ending by marriage between groups. As
                                        Jowitt notes, "the plot of The Sea Voyage follows the
                                        haphazard and hostile interaction between these colonies

                                        from different groups, they work together to sustain Albert.
                                        Clarinda's nutritional provision for Albert is supplemented
                                        by Aminta's romantic/sexual provision for him, which in turn
                                        makes possible the ensuing sequence of events that ends the
                                        play in a way that ensures the survival of all involved. The
                                        idea of union between two factions is again emphasized, but
                                        beyond that it juxtaposes the threat to survival posed by
                                        division and distinction between groups, neither of which
                                        have all the necessary means of survival without the other.
                                        As Jowitt points out, it is only "Between the separate
                                        factions [that] there are enough resources to ensure a

                                        many early modern playhouses, including the second Globe
                                        where this play was performed in 1622, it is likely the
                                        "curtain" to which Aminta refers is the arras across a
                                        "discovery space" in the middle of the tiring house wall
                                        which would have hidden Albert from view. As Syme notes,
                                        "Even if there was no central stage door, there would have
                                        been an area between the two entrances that lay concealed
                                        behind an arras or curtain that could be drawn to reveal

                                        here is doubly felt because the prisoners have no access to
                                        food at all, let alone a type of food that was difficult to
                                        make and considered a luxury. Bottarga is enjoyed more
                                        widely today, but it is still considered a delicacy

                                        sexual connotations because in this era oysters were viewed
                                        as a venereal symbol and considered an aphrodisiac. More
                                        specifically, oysters were associated with vulvas. Beyond
                                        that, Gordon Williams notes that during the period a woman
                                        could be "defined through her sexual part"
                                        (<ref target="#gw1994">982</ref>). The Master is essentially sexualizing
                                        the Amazons and reducing them to their anatomy. "Gape" is
                                        additionally suggestive in this context as it could imply
                                        the Master and Tibalt resent the women's power over their
                                        own sexuality: the women are imagined to be opening their
                                        own sexual anatomy and thus exerting control of their sexual
                                        fates.</note></l>

                                        innuendo is imperative to understanding the exchange among
                                        the characters. In response to Crocale, who says Tibalt and
                                        the Master are "not men," the Master assures her she will
                                        find a "salt eel" (a phallic symbol) if she should "search"
                                        them. This image is soon met by an observation that the
                                        women "gape like oysters." As oysters were understood to
                                        represent the vagina, their gaping suggests the sexual
                                        desire of the women themselves. The phrase "crept into us"
                                        makes the sexual connotations of his speech unmistakable,
                                        allowing the "necessities" and "wants" of the women to
                                        equivocate with both sexual desire and the desire of
                                        obedience from the men. Sex is then tied to power for the
                                        women as it is to food for the men.</note></l>

                                            at</term>: much of Tibalt and the Master's frustration
                                        with their imprisonment seems to be that they regard the
                                        Amazons' behavior as "unwomanly." Tibalt is willing to
                                        accept a painful death, but he refuses to accept the
                                        commanding behavior and attitude of the women in charge of
                                        him, and states that he would be willing to accept their
                                        position if they acted more ladylike and milder. Tibalt and
                                        the Master seem to have strong perceptions of how women
                                        should act, and these Amazon women do not adhere to their
                                        expectations, suggesting it is the reversal of gender roles
                                        that are key to the conflict in this moment.</note></l>

                                        value, now, is procreative. In an era where men
                                        traditionally provide for the household but women ultimately
                                        create life, the power dynamic has been turned upside down,
                                        with both parties still depending on the other, but for
                                        reversed services.</note></l>

                                        in this play, "meat" also references a man's sexual desire
                                        for a woman's body. In <title>The Sexual Politics of
                                            Meat</title>, Carol Adams discusses the ways that
                                        references to meat-eating is directly linked to masculine
                                        aspects of our own modern culture (<ref target="#cja2015">1</ref>).
                                            <title>The Sea Voyage</title> reflects this same dynamic
                                        throughout. For example, Morillat suggests that Albert
                                        captured Aminta for his own "appetite." Throughout it is
                                        only the men who beg for meat and seem to have this kind of
                                        "appetite." This emphasis on meat throughout, as opposed to
                                        other food sources, suggests that the <title>The Sea
                                            Voyage</title> is exploring the complicated ways in
                                        which meat and women's bodies are equivocated during the
                                        early modern period.</note></l>

                                early modern drama, a table itself as a prop could be considered an
                                extravagant display considering set design tended to be
                                minimalistic. Most of the money spent by theater companies was
                                invested more in costumes than sets. As a result, plays during the
                                period had remarkably spare stages, requiring the audience to rely
                                heavily on their imagination to furnish the setting. Seeing a table
                                furnished with lots of props would likely stand out to the audience,
                                and suggests that the table will be the center of gravity for the
                                scene. In other words, the action will revolve around the table,
                                directly and indirectly.</note></stage>

                                    directions are provided to indicate Crocale is hiding or has
                                    stepped aside. Additionally, no stage directions specify that
                                    Hippolita and Juletta exit. Rather, these must simply be
                                    inferred from the dialogue. During this period, performances
                                    accomplished hiding characters in several ways. In the
                                    Blackfriars Theatre, for example, Crocale could 'hide' by
                                    sitting with the audience, as some of the audience in the
                                    Blackfriars sat on the side of the stage. Another place
                                    for Crocale to hide could be up on a balcony (which many early
                                    modern theaters had), watching the action from up above. The most
                                    important aspect of this stage direction is possibly not that
                                    Crocale is visible to the audience, but that the audience
                                    actually knows she is hiding.</note>

                                        and island containing all that they actually needed to
                                        survive. It was also said by Rosella that they became
                                        self-sufficient, learning to accomplish everything necessary
                                        for survival that they had once depended on the men for.
                                        This suggests that they did not, in the end, need men at all
                                        to thrive as a community, just as they did not require
                                        jewels or other treasures of materialistic.</note></l>

                                            ... nothing</term>: Sebastian reclaims his wife, after
                                        also proclaiming that Clarinda will be a good wife and that
                                        she will take on Rosella's virtues. Jane O'Brien discusses
                                        the trajectory of a woman's life in the period: "Whether
                                        they're mothers, ingenues or unruly woman, they are all
                                        women discovering how to find their way in the world. And
                                        it's a pretty tough world." In a way, Clarinda must now,
                                        like her mother, "find [her] way in the world," but in a
                                        form that is only granted to her by her father. So, while
                                        she may have freedom, she may also lack it, both in this
                                        scene and, presumably, throughout her life.</note></l>

                                        speech implies there will be a wedding, but no actual
                                        marriage ceremony occurs in the play. This is somewhat
                                        typical of seventeenth century comedies, where marriage is
                                        promised but not enacted. As a result, the play closes with
                                        a seemingly optimistic future, but one that has not yet come
                                        about, making the play's ending more ambiguous.</note></l>
